This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

.request

.response
include::{snippets}/test-create-user/http-response.adoc[]

.request
include::{snippets}/test-delete-user/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/test-delete-user/http-response.adoc[]

.request
include::{snippets}/test-delete-user_-throws-exception-when-user-not-found/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/test-delete-user_-throws-exception-when-user-not-found/http-response.adoc[]

.request
include::{snippets}/test-get-user/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/test-get-user/http-response.adoc[]

.request
include::{snippets}/test-update-user/http-request.adoc[]

.response
include::{snippets}/test-update-user/http-response.adoc[]

.request

.response
include::{snippets}/test-update-user_-throws-exception-when-user-does-not-exist/http-response.adoc[]

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
